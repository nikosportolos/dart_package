# dart_package

Optimize your Dart & Flutter package development workflow with the
[**dart_package**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dart-package) GitHub Action.

This action helps you streamline your development process cycle by automating in-depth package analysis,
running tests, tracking code-coverage with [Codecov](https://codecov.io), as well as hassle-free
publishing on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), saving you time and effort.

## Setup

### Setting up secrets in GitHub

In order to upload Coverage reports to Codecov or/and to publish a package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)
we need to set up the corresponding tokens as secrets in our GitHub repository.

You can find [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces)
more information about secrets & environment variables.

Your secrets in your GitHub repository should look like that:

<a href="https://github.com/nikosportolos/dart_package/blob/main/assets/images/github_secret.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://github.com/nikosportolos/dart_package/blob/main/assets/images/github_secret.png" width="80%" alt="github-secrets">
</a>

- #### Setup Codecov

The unique repository upload token is found on the settings page of your project.
You need write access to view this token.

For GitHub repositories the token will be found in `https://codecov.io/github/<owner>/<repo>/settings`.

  <img src="https://github.com/nikosportolos/dart_package/blob/main/assets/images/codecov_token.png" width="80%" alt="codecov-token">
</a>

- #### Pub.dev

You can acquire your `pub-credentials.json` simply by running the command `dart pub login` and logging in to pub.dev
with your Gmail account via a browser.

The `pub-credentials.json` will be generated in the default dart config folder in your system.

You can find it depending on your OS in the following directories:

- On **Linux** _(see XDG specification)_

  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is defined:
    - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dart/pub-credentials.json`
  - else
    - `$HOME/.config/dart/pub-credentials.json`

- On **MacOS** _(see [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com))_

  - `~/Library/Application Support/dart/pub-credentials.json`

- On **Windows**
  - `%APPDATA%/dart/pub-credentials.json`

> **Please notice** that the `pub-credentials.json` needs to be encoded into a base64 string
> before adding it to your repository secrets.
>
> You can easily encode it using the following command:
>
> `base64 ./pub-credentials.json > output.txt`
